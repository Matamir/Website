    projectDescription:`An android app to find the best way to travel between two cities.  In a class for Mobile Application Development, 
    I used the techniques I learned earlier in the class to work with a small group to create an android app.  We used Google's Firebase 
    Authentication to implement user authentication and Firestore as our database.  We utilized several different APIs in order to find 
    different travel options between cities, and implemented sorting and filtering options to allow users to refine their search.`,

  {projectName:`Discord Bot`,

    The bot had different responses based on key words or the sender of a message, as well as fully random responses.
    The bot was hosted using an always-on repl.it
    This required reading though fairly extensive documentation, as well as testing in a discord server to find a good frequency for the bot to respond.`,

  {projectName:`Photo Editor`,
    projectLanguages:`Java`,
    projectDescription:`Worked with a partner to create a photo editor following the Model-View-Controller design pattern and Object-Oriented-Design principles.
    Features included: import/export functionality from various file formats, image filtering (including blur, sharpen, grayscale, sepia, and mosaic), image layering, and the ability to execute scripts.
    We also created our own image file format very similar to PPM which could be interpreted by our program and could be imported and exported.
    Finally we created a very simple GUI from which these features could be used.
    This project was done over the course of about a month.  
    Unfortunately we were asked not to make a public github repository, but a private repository is available upon request.`,

    The game is playable from the IDE console, displayed using strings, and takes inputs from the user to make moves.

  {projectName:`Flood-it`,
    projectLanguages:`Java`,
    projectDescription:`Created Flood-it game in Java with a selectable board size from 1x1 to 64x64, two player functionality, and record keeping for best time and fewest clicks.
    The board randomly generates once the size is selected, coloring in each position with one of five colors (the game could take any non-zero number of colors, but the assignment called for five).
    The program also generates a goal number of clicks for the player to fill the whole board, based on the board size they chose.  If that goal is met, the user score is set as the record to beat, and the new click goal.
    This project was based on the example found <a href="https://unixpapa.com/floodit/" target="_blank">here</a>.

  {projectName:`Tetris`,

    The game included: randomly generating one of eight pieces, clearing full rows, score keeping for cleared rows, and gravity dropping rows above cleared rows.
    The user is also able to start the game with partially filled in rows, giving as inputs the number of rows and the probability that any given square in the row is filled.
